# Jessicas in TN Process
The data, notebooks, and process notes for TN-Jessicas-Project
---
This is the second published webpage I made for the 2024 Lede Program. For this assignment, we were tasked with creating a visualization for [this data.](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html)

I found the full list overwhelming, so I elected to focus on the subject I know best: myself! I narrowed down the data to just my state and wanted to see what I could find out about my own first name's popularity.

This was my first time successfully working with ai2html and a scrollama template and, while challenging, I found it fun.

My ultimate finding surprised me a great deal - and I hope one of those 19 Jessicas reaches out!
